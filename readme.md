# JavaScript queue data structure

Ideal for “first in first out” cases, where the first thing needs to be done before any of the others.

Adapted from [Queue Data Structure in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-queue-data-structure-in-javascript) into a working demo, with an extra `listQueue()` function.

The checkboxes and "X" hilite just show how to use the HTML `data-` attribute when generating elements.
